# Kickstart-2020-round-a-allocation

My approch

counter to what we can see, this problem was not a knapsack
you want the maximum house to buy so the more the house is cheap the more you can buy max house
So what i did here is to just sort the list and count the number of house we have until the money limit exceeds
